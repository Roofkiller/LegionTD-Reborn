0.7.12

## General Changes

- The final duel now decides the game as each team's king teleports to the middle of the map to settle things once and for all. During the final duel, kings have HP reduced by 30%, Health regen reduced by 20%, and a damage penalty of 15% of base damage.

- Setup time before duels is now less than for other rounds, 10 seconds instead of 35.

## Builders

- Elemental Builder rework: Gods now upgrade from Elementals instead of Benders (Benders are the basic summon). Their upgrade costs have been decreased so they still have the same total gold cost, but the upgrade still requires one additional food.

	Old:

	Waterbender (40) + Upgrade to Watergod (180) = 220
	Thunderbender (65) + Upgrade to Thundergod (310) = 375
	Earthbender (70) + Upgrade to Earthgod (390) = 460
	Firebender (75) + Upgrade to Firegod (450) = 525
	Voidbender (100) + Upgrade to Voidgod (500) = 600

	New:

	Waterbender (40) + Upgrade to Waterelemental (85) + Upgrade to Watergod (95) = 220
	Thunderbender (65) + Upgrade to Thunderelemental (130) + Upgrade to Thundergod (180) = 375
	Earthbender (70) + Upgrade to Earthelemental (200) + Upgrade to Earthgod (190) = 460
	Firebender (75) + Upgrade to Fireelemental (180) + Upgrade to Firegod (270) = 525
	Voidbender (100) + Upgrade to Voidelemental (90) + Upgrade to Voidgod (410) = 600

- Fire God attack range from 600 to 260, and supernova trigger range from 100 to 300. (Fire God should use its ability much more now).
