0.7.9b

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a case where missing players could cause round-start to fail, preventing unlocking of player units and causing some income units to not get sent.

- Fixed a case where players could miss the tango-ticker event if they spawned late.

- Fixed Firewarrior and Firegod having switched unit IDs.

## Gameplay

- Removed Human Builder Futuristic Gyrocopter Flak Cannon.

- Human Builder Guardian Angel will now put all other friendly Guardian Angels in its range on cooldown when starting cast.

- Fixed Human Builder Blademaster missing his Blade Dance skill.

- Wave Bosses now have a passive magic immunity ability with a 10 second duration and 16 second cooldown (so bosses have 6 out of every 16 seconds where they aren't magic immune).

- Disconnected players will have a leak penalty equivalent to 25 units (+250% tango generation interval) until a wave starts while they are connected.

- Rearranged Human Builder Block tooltip variables to be more clear
