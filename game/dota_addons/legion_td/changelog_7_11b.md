0.7.11b

- Each team can only have 90 send units in their "pit" at one time. When an additional send is purchased, the cheapest will be destroyed. (You still earn income for sends that are instantly destroyed in this way)

- Purchase cooldown for the first row of units has been removed. (kobold, hill troll shaman, hill troll warrior, and harpy)

- Fixed not being able to build a unit quickly in a space where a unit was sold.

- Fixed being able to build units between waves. (Previously you could do this by issuing a build command during setup in such a way that the actual spawn would happen after wave starts, creating a unit that would never "unfreeze" until the next wave.)
